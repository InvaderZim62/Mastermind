//  This class contains the properties that change with screen orientation.  They are computed based on
//  the layout of BoardView.  Since the order that iOS calls layoutSubviews for each view (BoardView,
//  ResultsView, pallet UIView,...) is arbitrary, the properties are updated in
//  MastermindViewController.viewDidLayoutSubviews, which is called after the views are layed out, but
//  before the layoutSubviews functions are called.
