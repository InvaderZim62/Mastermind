# Mastermind

Mastermind is a 1970s board game manufactured by Pressman Toys.

Try to guess the hidden colors using the marbles along the bottom.  The same color may be used more
than once.  After each guess, the results are shown with the little circles on the right.  White
circles indicate the number of correct colors in the wrong positions.  Black circles indicate the
number of correct colors in the correct positions.  Use past results to narrow in on the answer.

A settings screen allows you to change the number of hidden colors and guesses.
